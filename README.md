## Documentation

The PDF Rendition module provides a simple mechanism to quickly produce PDF 
versions of HTML pages generated by SilverStripe. 



## Installation Instructions

<Step by step instructions>

## Usage Overview

The quickest way to utilise the module is to add the controller extension that
adds a 'topdf' action to each of your pages.

	Object::add_extension('Page_Controller', 'PdfControllerExtension');

Alternatively, you can use the 'PDFRenditionService' API to generate PDFs when
and however you like

Please see http://github.com/nyeholt/silverstripe-pdfrendition/wiki for
further information.

## Known issues

**Rendition Failures**

Occasionally a page won't correctly render, throwing some kind of junk
back to the browser as the PDF rendition process fails. Typically,
this is caused by malformed XML being sent to the renderer; for this reason
everything is first passed through HTML Tidy, however in some rare cases
this can still not correctly convert the raw content.

In these cases, errors will be sent through to your error log files; it
will indicate the temporary files that were created, so you should first
check these for XML errors. If that does not work, you can also
attempt to manually perform the conversion using commandline tidy
and the commandline for the PDF rendition to see if there are more
verbose errors available for debugging the problem.
